#   .\build.ps1                  # self-contained single exe (no .NET needed to run)
#   .\build.ps1 -Framework       # small exe, requires the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime
#   .\build.ps1 -Compress        # smaller exe, double the memory -- see the table

# Measured on 0.7.3, private bytes with the flyout open:
#
#              exe     memory   target machine needs
#   default   166 MB    80 MB   nothing
#   -Framework 25 MB    80 MB   .NET 8 Desktop Runtime
#   -Compress  70 MB   160 MB   nothing
#
# -Compress saves 96 MB of download and costs 80 MB of memory for as long as the app is
# running: a compressed bundle cannot be mapped, so every assembly loaded is decompressed
# into private memory. Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.dll alone -- the Windows SDK's WinRT
# projection, which this app touches only for toasts -- is 25 MB of that.
#
# -Framework and the default cost exactly the same memory, because both map their
# assemblies off disk. The 6.6x size difference is the whole of what separates them, and
# it is paid on every update the built-in updater downloads.
#
# So -Zip publishes both, and the updater picks the one matching what is already installed
# (Updater.IsUsableAsset, against the deployment mode stamped in by Herdi.Win.csproj):
#
#   Herdi-<arch>-<version>.zip       self-contained, runs on a machine with no .NET
#   Herdi-<arch>-<version>-fdd.zip   framework-dependent, a sixth the download
#
# Both must be uploaded to the release. Publishing only the -fdd one would brick every
# self-contained install whose machine has no .NET 8 Desktop Runtime; publishing only the
# other just makes every update six times larger than it needs to be.
#
# ASCII only, deliberately. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads .ps1 files as ANSI unless they
# carry a UTF-8 BOM, so on a non-Latin system locale a stray multi-byte character here is
# re-decoded as something else -- and one of them used to swallow a closing quote, which
# turned the notes at the bottom into code and failed the whole script after a successful
# build. Keeping this file to ASCII means the encoding can never matter.
