/// RelayConnection (Sources/RelayConnection.swift), including both of its modes: a
/// WebSocket to the relay, or <see cref="HerdrPoller"/> driving the herdr CLI here —
/// locally and over SSH.
///
/// Both modes share one merge path (<see cref="Upsert"/>), so grouping, toasts and the
/// answered-elsewhere retraction behave identically whichever is active. The mac app
/// keeps two separate merge loops and they have drifted apart.
///
/// Relay mode watches <em>every</em> configured relay at once rather than one at a time.
/// It used to hold a single socket, so a second relay meant editing the URL in Settings —
/// which is not switching between two views of one herd, it is throwing one herd away. The
/// panes of all of them land in one list and are triaged together, because NEEDS YOU is
/// the ordering that matters and a blocked agent does not become less urgent for being on
/// the other relay. Which relay a row came from is a tag on the row
/// (<see cref="Agent.SourceLabel"/>), shown only once there is more than one.
///
/// Three things follow from that and each was a bug the single-socket shape could not have:
///
/// - <b>Pane ids are only unique within one herdr.</b> Every relay hands out `w1:p1`, so
///   <see cref="Agent.Id"/> carries the source key and <see cref="Agent.PaneId"/> is what
///   goes back on the wire.
/// - <b>A snapshot speaks for its own relay only.</b> The `agents` message is a complete
///   list, but complete for the relay that sent it; the sweep that drops vanished panes is
///   scoped to that source or the relays would delete each other's rows every poll.
/// - <b>Connected is "any", not "all".</b> One unreachable tunnel must not make the dot red
///   while three relays are answering; it names itself in the tray instead.
