// tab -- because that is what is unknown there. In a space's own view both are already established
// by the heading above the card, so repeating them says nothing, and worse: two panes in one tab
// would become indistinguishable, since the pane's own name is the only thing telling them apart.

/** The pane's own name: the operator's label, else the pane id.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT `project`, which the relay sets to `basename(cwd)` -- a space's panes nearly all
 *  share it, so on a real host every card in `tmp-workspace` was called `tmp-workspace`, and so was
 *  the heading above them. The id is the only field that always separates two siblings.
 *
 *  Also what `rename_agent` is prefilled with and what the row announces, so those cannot drift from
 *  what the card shows. */

 *  `herdr-remote-dev` above `app-tools/herdr-remote-dev`, on row after row. Dropping it when the
