# is an ordinary numbered menu ("1. Submit answers", "2. Cancel"). Digits are absolute -- they do
# not depend on where the cursor sits -- which is what makes this drivable from a client that

# detector is cheaper than widening that rule and cannot regress the approval menus it was
# written for, because an approval row has no `[ ]` in it.
# The LABEL IS OPTIONAL, which is the whole reason this is one regex rather than two: the
# free-text row loses its label the moment it becomes the input (`5. [ ] Type something` renders
# as `5. [✔]`), and a row that vanished from the run would break the numbering every reader here

    parses, the relay still read it as a menu, and everything a reader typed was matched against
    the labels and sent as a KEY PRESS. A digit landed in the field as a character ("3", then
    "33" on the second try), a sentence that happened to equal a label pressed that label's
    number, and anything else was refused outright as "free-text response requires a detected
    question". The menu never closed, because nothing had been selected.

    The one thing that changes between the two states is the dialog's own footer: it gains
    "ctrl+g to edit in <editor>" exactly while the field has focus. The editor name is the
    reader's $EDITOR, so only the invariant half is matched. Verified against captures of all
    four states -- cursor on an ordinary option (absent), cursor on the field (present), and the
    field holding one and two typed characters (present).

    Matched against the screen with its WHITESPACE NORMALIZED, because every literal here lives
    in a footer and a footer wraps. Measured on a 46-column pane -- the width a herdr pane really
    has on this host -- the footer breaks mid-phrase, as "... ctrl+g to" / "edit in Nvim . Esc to
    cancel" on two lines, and a plain `in` against that finds nothing: the field was open, this
    returned False, and the relay went on offering option buttons that could only ever type their
